# CodeWars-Walkthrough
Solutions for some of the Kata's in CodeWars website.

## Kata
In our dojo, kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.
## Kyu/Dan Ranks
Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.
What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward.
Currently Dan level content is reserved for later. You will only find Kyu level content to train on for now.
## Earning Ranks
You can advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above your rank - the harder the kata the faster you advance.
## Honor
Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. Honor is earned fastest through creating kata, crafting great solutions, and constructive comments.
